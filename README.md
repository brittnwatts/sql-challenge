# sql-challenge

This ReadMe serves to:
   1. Certify that this work is my own,
   2. Specify code source and its location in my 'sql-challenge' repository,
   3. Clarify the reason for the assignment,

1. 
My name is Brittney Watts, and I am in the UNCC/EdX Data Analytics Bootcamp. Currently, we 
are working on Module 9 of our exploration into the PostegreSQL language in the pgAdmin server.

2. 
The source code is my interpretation of the information we have learned in class with some debugging help from forums, and here
is a breakdown of the locations of each element of my assignment:

This assignment serves to track my understanding of the SQL language, data modeling, and data manipulation.

Employee SQL Challenge:
   My task was to read the data from the csv files and perform queries on the datasets. 
   The CSV files were all files with important information about the employees for company "Pewlard Hackett". 
   
   My Steps: 
      - First, I had to create an ERD with the csv information I was given. I made sure that I was specifying the correct data types, PKs, and FKs. I also had to create two composite keys for two of the files because they had no primary key columns with unique values. 


      - Import the CSV files into their respective SQL tables.
      

      - Once I had all the files imported, I had to perform a data analysis.


      - List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.


      - List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.


      - List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.


      - List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.


      - List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.


      - List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.


      - List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.


      - List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
